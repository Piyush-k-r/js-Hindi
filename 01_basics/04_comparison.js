//console.log("2" > 1); here the 2 will be coverted into 2 number for comparison
 
console.log(null > 0);  // false
console.log(null == 0); // false
console.log(null >= 0);  // true   => reason is that an equality check == and comparisons > <>= <= woek diffrently
//                                   Comparison convert null to a number, treating it as 0 .That's why null >= is true and null>0 is false

// === strict check   => it check value plus the data type also of the ones which are being comapred
